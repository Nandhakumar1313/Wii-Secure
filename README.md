## Project Overview
Wii-Secure aims to create a secure infrastructure for organizations by detecting and blocking malicious traffic, authenticating users, and managing threats in real-time. It offers a client-side cross-platform application for network scanning, proxy configuration, and monitoring, which interacts with a backend server hosted on AWS. The backend utilizes various components like a traffic analyzer, threat detection module, and alerting system to provide comprehensive protection against cyber threats.

## Features
->Real-Time Network Traffic Analysis: Captures and inspects network packets using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to identify suspicious patterns.

->Threat Detection Using Machine Learning: Classifies network packets as benign or malicious with high accuracy through trained machine learning models.

->Proactive Alerting System: Notifies administrators of detected threats with detailed information on potential attacks.

->Comprehensive Logging and Reporting: Continuous traffic logging and summary reporting for long-term insights into network behavior and threat trends.

->Secure VPN Setup with RSA Encryption: Ensures data confidentiality and integrity during network communication.

## Environment Setup
1)Install Required Packages:
Install OpenVPN, iptables, nDPI, libnetfilter-queue-dev, and relevant ML libraries on a Linux server.

2)VPN Encryption:
Generate RSA keys using OpenSSL and configure OpenVPN for secure user data encryption.

3)Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):
Set up nDPI to inspect network traffic and flag suspicious activity.

4)Packet Filtering:
Configure iptables with NetfilterQueue to capture and filter network packets.

5)Machine Learning Integration:
Train an ML model to classify traffic and integrate it for real-time detection.

6)Firewall Configuration:
Use iptables to control network traffic, allowing only trusted gateway communication.

7)Automation and Deployment:
Set up automation scripts to launch, monitor, and refine the system on a dedicated server.

## Usage
->Launch the Client Application: Access the client-side app to connect to the backend via OpenVPN.

->Monitor Network Activity: View real-time network traffic and threat alerts on the client dashboard.

->Manage Threats: Use the dashboard to review threat logs and configure user permissions.

## Enhanced Machine Learning Models:
->Integrate deep learning techniques for more accurate and adaptive threat detection.

->Real-Time Dashboard: Develop a customizable dashboard for visual monitoring of network activity and alerts.

->Threat Intelligence Integration: Incorporate external threat intelligence feeds to enhance threat detection capabilities.

->Automated Incident Response: Add functionality for automated incident response to improve reaction times and efficiency.
